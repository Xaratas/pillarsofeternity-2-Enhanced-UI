By passing through the gate Glasvahl hoped to obtain his greatest wish: &lt;i&gt;final death&lt;/i&gt;; removing his soul from the churn of Berath’s Wheel and embracing the entropy that follows in it's wake.</DefaultText>

&lt;line-indent=15em&gt;othas is the god of light and redemption, often represented as a young man holding a
candle and wearing a crown of shining silver or as his messengers, the Dawnstars.
Influence over the sun and stars contributes to his overall air of grandeur and importance, putting Eothas at odds with the rest of the pantheon. By divine command, his churches are strictly regulated in their laws of the faith. A candle, lantern, or torch must burn in the center of every room, banishing “shadows of unfaithful” to vacant doorways (&lt;link="gamedata://f647c4e8-baa3-4f25-87b3-01fed733ee33"&gt;Berath&lt;/link&gt;’s realm). Doves are traditionally housed in towering rookeries, and crows hunted for miles around.&lt;/line-indent&gt;

&lt;voffset=0.2em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Followers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/voffset&gt;&lt;/line-height&gt;
While worship of Eothas is still popular in the &lt;link="gamedata://592f117b-b43b-4602-b072-16d3f36ad031"&gt;Aedyran Empire&lt;/link&gt; and &lt;link="gamedata://c4270305-bea7-4069-b7ad-b52675c6a7a7"&gt;Readceras&lt;/link&gt;, the faith is outlawed or at least actively hated by the populace in most cities of &lt;link="gamedata://8e3055fe-0e67-4a92-ac9d-d4ff4d866466"&gt;Dyrwood&lt;/link&gt; due to events of the &lt;link="gamedata://e4da5221-c9c5-4591-9814-06eedb0fe409"&gt;Saint’s War&lt;/link&gt; that culminated at Halgot Citadel. Though Eothas once communicated regularly with his faithful, he has not done so since the destruction of &lt;link="gamedata://0eecddab-3670-481b-a7c2-06f335683024"&gt;Saint Waidwen&lt;/link&gt; at the Battle of Godhammer, almost two decades years ago.

Some of Eothas most notable followers include: &lt;link="gamedata://"&gt;The Children of the Dawnstars&lt;/link&gt;— Eothasian pilgrims fleeing a Raedceras entrenched in political upheaval that followed after the destruction of St. Waidwen; &lt;link="gamedata://"&gt;The Bright Shepherds&lt;/link&gt;— a devout group of pacifistic missionaries whom, instead of inflicting their faith on the world with the sword and pitchfork, sought to bring Eothas’s light to the dark places of the world — be they crypts, forest trails, or homes of the poor; &lt;link="gamedata://"&gt;The Night Market&lt;/link&gt;— a secret society of extraordinarily devoted Eothasians who tends to the needs of ordinary Eothasians who cannot worship publicly and tracks down and fight any dark forces that would threaten Dyrwood or it's Eothasian parishioners.

&lt;voffset=0.2em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Manifestations&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/voffset&gt;&lt;/line-height&gt;
“The Dawnstars” are a manifestation of Eothas that appear as the ethereal forms of a man and two women who represent three of the brightest stars in the sky, often the last three to remain visible before the sun rises. They act as heralds of things to come, or as heralds of things Eothas wants to come, and as advisers to mortals at critical junctures.

Once, Eothas took physical form by possesing the body of a farmer named “&lt;link="gamedata://0eecddab-3670-481b-a7c2-06f335683024"&gt;Waidwen&lt;/link&gt;”. Proclaimed a living saint by the deeply religious populace of Raedceras, Waidwen led the country into a war against their southern neighbors in the Dyrwood. The so-called Saint's War was a brutal conflict that ended with the destruction of Saint Waidwen via a unique device known as the Godhammer Bomb.

Eothas has a final, more intimidating aspect in the form of “&lt;link="gamedata://0e3d7d55-e2c2-4446-bc54-7673a71ba919"&gt;Gaun&lt;/link&gt;” — a farmer depicted as carrying a lantern and sickle. Gaun is a figure of dignified, cyclical death as opposed to &lt;link="gamedata://d1d95d7e-0617-4c0c-a8c5-233d3af1c2e2"&gt;Rymrgand&lt;/link&gt;’s entropic variety or Berath’s cold inevitability. In context, his presence surrounds the harvest, rebirth, spring, and the general celebration of mortality. His implements are symbolically important: the sickle reaps what is sowed in life, and the lantern guides the deceased down their intended paths of death and rebirth. It is generally believed that Gaun, instead of Berath’s avatars, visits those who embrace death with acceptance and understanding.&lt;/xg&gt;

&lt;line-indent=15em&gt;aint Waidwen (a.k.a. Divine King Waidwen or the Martyr King) was a &lt;link="gamedata://6e021ebe-d26c-40b4-b1d3-5f6315cc2742"&gt;vorlas&lt;/link&gt;
farmer living in a remote part of the colony of &lt;link="glossary://GlossaryEntry_Readceras_Cyclopedia"&gt;Readceras&lt;/link&gt;. According to legends, one
night &lt;link="gamedata://d5693399-d58f-4b1f-9d4a-51fc49ff2e91"&gt;the Dawnstars&lt;/link&gt; appeared to the young farmer and told him to punish the &lt;link="glossary://GlossaryEntry_Aedyr_Cyclopedia"&gt;Aedyran&lt;/link&gt; governor for leading the people to ruin. Waidwen went to his village and told people what he had seen and heard. Initially ignored and later attacked for his beliefs, Waidwen began manifesting miraculous powers. This drew devoted believers from all over his county and eventually fomented a popular revolt.&lt;/line-indent&gt;&lt;/line-height&gt; 

Waidwen, assisted by some knights and nobles who believed in his cause, eventually marched on the capital city and confronted the imperial governor. The governor was not killed, but was forced to abdicate power and leave the colony. Upon entering the seat of imperial power, Waidwen’s body physically transformed into something otherworldly. According to most records from the era, his flesh appeared to become luminescent and his head completely transformed into pure (sometimes literally blinding) light.

Stories say that people asked Waidwen to lead the colony and that he accepted, becoming the first and only “Divine King” of Readceras. As king, his rule was virtually uncontested. He immediately punished allies of the empire and what he believed were corrupt churches and church leaders of Eothas. It was not long before worshipers of Eothas were punished for perceptions of heresy and nonworshipers were punished for following other faiths. When Readceran citizens fled to &lt;link="glossary://GlossaryEntry_Dyrwood_Cyclopedia"&gt;Dyrwood&lt;/link&gt; for sanctuary, it caused strife between the two nations that eventually led to &lt;link="glossary://GlossaryEntry_TheSaintsWar_Cyclopedia"&gt;the Saint’s War&lt;/link&gt;.

During the conflict, Waidwen personally led many battles and exhibited extraordinary supernatural powers. Accounts describe him as being virtually untouchable and rumored that he was indestructible, possibly a full manifestation of Eothas’s power in the world. He was able to burn or even fully disintegrate enemies with beams of pure light.

It was not until the “Battle of Halgot Citadel” that he was significantly wounded. On that occasion, he was more than wounded: he was fully destroyed. The Dyrwoodans had constructed a massive bomb — &lt;link=""&gt;the Godhammer&lt;/link&gt; — and placed it inside the stonework of the &lt;link="gamedata://2278f825-9152-41ec-a590-66d4bfe95593"&gt;Evon Dewr Bridge&lt;/link&gt; that lead to the citadel gates. They also warned and swore to the Readcerans that Waidwen could never cross the bridge, trusting that his ultimate confidence would lead him directly over it. This was exactly what happened, and the resulting explosion apparently destroyed Waidwen, half a regiment of Readceran knights, and about a dozen Dyrwoodans who sacrificed themselves to stall the saint on the bridge.&lt;/xg&gt;

&lt;line-indent=15em&gt;aun is an aspect of Eothas associated with death and harvests. Gaun is a figure of
dignified, cyclical death as opposed to &lt;link="glossary://GlossaryEntry_Rymrgand_Cyclopedia"&gt;Rymrgand&lt;/link&gt;’s entropic variety or &lt;link="glossary://GlossaryEntry_Berath_Cyclopedia"&gt;Berath&lt;/link&gt;’s cold
inevitability. In context, his presence surrounds the harvest, rebirth, spring, and the general celebration of mortality. His implements are symbolically important: the sickle reaps what is sowed in life, and the lantern guides the deceased down their intended paths of death and rebirth. It is generally believed that Gaun, instead of Berath’s avatars, visits those who embrace death with acceptance and understanding.&lt;/line-indent&gt;&lt;/line-height&gt;

Gaun still fits with Eothas’s character as a bringer of light, but incorporates a sense of relentlessness that proves more disconcerting than hopeful. The weak and the underprivileged - while not necessarily under Gaun’s protection - are nevertheless under his scrutiny in case anyone should seek to do them harm. Gaun is an answerer of wrongs and imbalances, or whatever he interprets as imbalance. This has contributed in no small part to &lt;link="glossary://GlossaryEntry_Dyrwood_Cyclopedia"&gt;Dyrwood&lt;/link&gt;’s enthusiasm for vigilante justice. Popular regard for Gaun is polarizing: he is appreciated and feared, and exudes a grim sense of finality.

His most fervent devotees are known as “Harvesters of Gaun”.&lt;/xg&gt;

      <DefaultText>In the midst of this political upheaval in Readceras, a fraction of the citizens who held back from joining Waidwen’s militaristic advance turned away from their home colony with disappointment and sorrow. They did not mourn the death of Waidwen, but judged the departure of Eothas as a call to change their ways. Instead of inflicting their faith on the world with the sword and pitchfork, their goal was to bring Eothas’s light to the dark places of the world — be they crypts, forest trails, or homes of the poor.

The Bright Shepherds sought to escape those who would vilify them both near and abroad, and departed Readceras under cover of night. Having invested much of their time and resources in working with tallow and beeswax, they were able to support themselves on the sale of candles. Many a Dyrwoodan lord who illuminated their keep (and cursed all Readcerans) unknowingly did so by the light of Eothasian candles.

Rituals and demonstrations across the continent necessarily went underground, save for the rare instances when the worship of Eothas could be overlooked in plain sight. One such practice traces back to the peaceful Bright Shepherd expatriates, who made regular pilgrimages between Dyrwood and the borders of their former homeland. Rather than any particular sites or landmarks, the journey itself was their objective, as they would place lit candles along the path between nations. Theirs was not a fanatical devotion to Eothas, but a mild and hopeful one, in which they invited their god to find his way home. The candles represented a path outlined for Eothas to return when his people needed him most.

The Bright Shepherds’ continued existence depends partially on the Night Market, a secretive and devout sect of Eothasians who ensure that their peers are able to worship freely and unhin- dered. When bounty hunters or mobs track down Eothasians, the Night Market acts to deter or waylay these figures before they catch up with their charges. Being both pacifists and often isolated in the Dyrwoodan wilderness, the Bright Shepherds are some of the Market’s most vulnerable clients.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>The Night Market is a secret society of extraordinarily devoted Eothasians who operate in Dyrwood. In addition to ministering to the needs of ordinary Eothasians who cannot worship publicly, the Night Market attempts to track and fight against any dark forces that would threaten Dyrwood. Their hope is that they can mend the relationship between Dyrwoodans and Eothas by performing heroic, patriotic acts for the benefit of all residents of Dyrwood.</DefaultText>

      <DefaultText>After the death of Saint Waidwen (Saint’s War, 2808 AI), melancholy swept through the theocratic colony of Readceras. Eothasians struggled to find meaning in the defeat of their god. Scrambling to restore order, battle-hardened priests transformed their government into a penitential regency which could function until Eothas inevitably returned to reclaim his throne. All the while, the citizens of Readceras who didn’t flee the vengeance of their enemies turned on their neighbors, rooting out faithlessness wherever it could be found and blaming it for their downfall. These were times of stress, accusation, guilt, and cruelty.

On top of their other woes, the Readceran crops of dye-producing vorlas plants failed to yield a harvest, which led to a crippling economic downturn. Some ten thousand of the faithful left the colony to seek employment where they could find it, and where persecution would not follow. Aiming their ships toward the rising sun was an act as symbolic as it was practical, narrowing their purpose on a trajectory with a symbol of hope and rebirth.

To the delight of these wayward pilgrims, their crops took to Deadfire soil better than they had in Readceras, where the Aedyran emperor had always insisted on planting crops which were ill suited to the region. Those who persisted in farming eventually settled on peaberries as a hardy staple crop. Others relocated to colonial settlements or Huana villages, where they carved out positions of usefulness in tribal society and spread their Eothasian faith without fear of oppression.

Owing to their selfless ambitions, the Dawnstars have enjoyed favorable dealings with the Huana. As far as the trading companies are concerned, close involvement with local affairs has earned the Dawnstars a reputation as petty irritants, though nothing approaching violence has broken out over largely political and ethical conflicts.</DefaultText>
